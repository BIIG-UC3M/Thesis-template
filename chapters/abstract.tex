Light microscopy in the \acrfull{nir2} window has shown to be a very promising approach to increase the depth of penetration and reduce the loss of resolution of deep tissue images in \acrfull{lsfm} and \acrfull{opt}.
In this spectral window the scattering of light in biological tissue samples is much weaker than in the visible, where this phenomenon limits the penetration to a few hundreds of microns for \textit{in vivo} specimens and non cleared tissues.
