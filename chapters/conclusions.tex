The work presented in this thesis contributes to the comprehension of the propagation regime of light in optical imaging in the \gls{nir} and more in particular in the \gls{nir2} spectral window. The applications of this study are focused on \gls{opt} and \gls{lsfm} since these two techniques have become very popular among the research community and the recent literature shows a strong interest in this spectral windows. Measurements in the \gls{nir} demonstrated to fall in the yet uncharacterized ballistic to diffusion transition regime of light and thus this research covers the development of novel methods to model light propagation, the assessment of existing microscopy techniques in a variety of scattering media and the exploration of new acquisition methods for mesoscopic \gls{opt} to overcome the new challenges that imaging in the \gls{nir2} window and sets. It is important to outline that the findings of this work apply also for any low scattering media where the effects of dispersion cannot be neglected.
