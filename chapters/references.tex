% The Springer template uses natbib, we modify it to use biblatex    %
% since we needed biber preprocessing to solve the issue with months %
% in citations. 
% We had to do some tricks to actually make it work with the right   %
% format for headers and also in the table of contents.              %


\chapter*{References}       % Looks better with chapter style title 
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{References} % Append section to ToC
\markboth{References}{References}   % Force the right header
\printbibliography[heading=none]    % Print bibliography
