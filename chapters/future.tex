This thesis has presented several approaches to tackle light propagation modeling and the assessment of the performance of light microscopes in low scattering tissue. During the development of the computational tools, many of the experiments motivated new improvements and functionalities. Some of the ideas that came out during the process could not be implemented but we consider of importance to include them in this section.
